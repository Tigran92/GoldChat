Group project - Gold Chat

I'll bet you no one will read the readme

I had a better chance of doing this project entirely alone, managing Static pages were the most painful part of implementation.

Even after reading through the ***'amazing'*** final report, several parts of the write up is just plainly awful.

Group projects are just bad, I've spent majority of my time not investing to the ***product*** itself but managing this group to get me simple assets.

Given that, If they claim they have done work, well so be it, life wouldn't be as easy in the further.
